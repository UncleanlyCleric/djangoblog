# django-blog-9

Lesson 09:  Deployment - http://py230-ubtuntu02004013.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/

Currently everything is working.  

I added links to the polls, blog, and API to the nav bar.  Users can login via a local account, Facebook, Google, and Twitter.  Once a user is created, I can add them to the staff, and a special "Users" group to allow them to post.  (As tested by my friend, my brother, and my wife).  As admin I have the option of deleting the users posts.

The API has been tested, and will in fact pull post information.  As posting is locked down, that is not an option.
